<h3><p>Amidst the coronavirus outbreak, many of us may worry that an onset of cough or fever may mean we have contracted the virus and rushing to the hospital might seem like the next viable option. However, not only do hospitals have finite resources, they are also hotbeds of harmful bacteria and diseases. Heading to the hospital when you don't actually need to might just worsen the situation for yourself and your community.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our state-of-the-art test is carefully curated by seasoned healthcare professionals and using real-time COVID-19 statistics, we will determine if a trip to the hospital is really necessary. You can take this test from the comfort of your own home and receive professional advice on what your following actions should be.</p>
